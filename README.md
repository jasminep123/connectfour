Connect four Code test

Technical choices I chose to use Java because this is the language that ovarro preferes and i have some experience writing JUnit tests so i could add automated tests to the code. Java also allowed me to create classes and methods for the game making it more readable and easier to test.

The app had the following requirements

Allow the player(s) to configure the size of the grid and the winning row length (i.e. A player could need 4, 5, or 3 tokens, etc. in a row to win the game)
Initialise a new game grid.
Add a token to the game grid. A token can be either Red or Yellow. A token is added to a specified grid column.
Show the game grid state/progress in the console or log to a file.
Show the next player to play, Red or Yellow.
Show the winner.
How To Run

Setup Clone the project using git clone and open in an IDE of your choice. Configure Build for the connect four game and the junit tests. Runnning tests - run the build configuration for JUnit. Running application - Run the build configuration for the apllication.

Please let me know if there are any issues.
